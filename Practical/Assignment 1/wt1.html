				<h4>Personal Details</h4>

				<p>Born on 20 nov 1999 in the city of maharashtra to a simple hindu koli family.
				We are two brothers and a sister. </p>
							
				<h4>Education Details</h4>
			
	<p>Initially went to svcs primary school until 2nd class then moved to live with my grandparents and my uncles in a small village called nilegoan in osmanabad district went to a z.p school which was just 100 metres away from my residence until 7th standard (because the only school in our village had 7 standards only) so again moved to solapur to complete the further education and matric at svcs high school.Then for collage, I choose to study diploma in computer engineering at Government Polytechnic solapur.Currently studying Btech at MITAOE.</p>     

				<h4>Interest and Skills</h4>
	<p>As i choose computer field i have created interests in the computer programming languages like the C which is my favourite programming language as it created the further interest in kernel programming. i am moderatly interested in computer security subject like many other who are always passionate about the security.I like the language which directly interact with kernel like the batch programming in windows and shell programming in linux although both of these are the scripting languages my interest is tilted towards the linux becuase i always used to be curious to study about the security and all stuff therefore i loved networking concepts as well. I am also very curious about the computer viruses i have created some and tried on my friends computers as well as on our collage computers. In short i am interested in problem solving.  
 
	<p>Apart from computer related things; i am interested in the history language which is second most favorite after computer releated stuff. In sports I like playing cricket(i am a good player) and love watching football (i am bad football player). I am quite interested in environmental work as well.</p>

				<h4>Achievements</h4>
	<p>At school level in dictrict level sankrit exam; i was ranked third in the district for 2 years at 9th and 10th class.
	   And always considered my little progress as my achievement.
