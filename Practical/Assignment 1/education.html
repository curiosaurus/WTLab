    	In my educational  life I have been in over 6 institutes. This was due to father changing his job. This made me have a lot of friends along these institutes. I was first admitted at Little Angel Kindergarden which only had nursery. Then Shreeji English school was where I studied my LKG then as we  shift to Loni(Pravaranagar) I was admitted to Little Flower School. this school followed ICSC board and was modern in its own ways. In there I explored my Extra Curricular talents and gave me my never ending stage daring and fearless to speak in front of crowds. Then in 5th we went to Nashik where I was in Sacred Heart Convent High School. This was orthodox and religious school. The school was SSC which made the books dull at the time. BUt the teachng was the same with more beating to prevent more of my naught. This is where I completed my 10th.
    		I made a career choice of IT after 10th by choosing GPN for Diploma in Engg. This where I explored a very different feild of study.
